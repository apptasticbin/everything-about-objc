/**
 - To establish a friendship from one person to another, you have to create an 
 instance of FriendInfo. If both people like each other, you have to create two 
 instances of FriendInfo.
 - To break a friendship, you must delete the appropriate instance of FriendInfo.
 - The delete rule from Person to FriendInfo should be Cascade. That is, if a person
 is removed from the store, then the FriendInfo instance becomes invalid, so it must 
 also be removed.
 - As a corollary, the relationships from FriendInfo to Person must not be optional—an
 instance of FriendInfo is invalid if the source or friend is null.
